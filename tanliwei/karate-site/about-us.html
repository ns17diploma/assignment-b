			<p>The Club is firmly based on the beliefs and principles established by Gichin Funakoshi (1868-1957)</p>

			<p>The priciples the Shotokan School is based upon the details below. </p>

			<p>Never forget: karate begins with rei and ends with rei (Rei means courtesy or respect, and is represented in karate by bowing)</p>
			<p>There is no first attack in karate</p>
			<p>Karate supports righteousness</p>
			<p>First understand yourself, then understand others</p>
			<p>The art of developing the mind is more important than the art of applying technique</p>
			<p>The mind needs to be freed</p>
			<p>Trouble is born of negligence / ignorance</p>
			<p>Do not think karate belongs only in the dojo</p>
			<p>Karate training requires a lifetime</p>
			<p>Transform everything into karate; therein lies its exquisiteness</p>
			<p>Karate is like hot water, if you do not give it heat constantly, it will again become cold water</p>
			<p>Do not think that you have to win, rather think you do not have to lose</p>
			<p>Transform yourself according to the opponent</p>
			<p>The outcome of the fight depends on one's control</p>
			<p>Imagine one's arms and legs as swords</p>
			<p>Once you leave the shelter of home, there are a million enemies</p>
			<p>Postures are for the beginner; later they are natural positions</p>
			<p>Perform the kata correctly; the real fight is a different matter</p>
			<p>Do not forget control of the dynamics of power, the elasticity of the body and the speed of the technique</p>
			<p>Apply the way of Karate to all things. Therein lies its beauty.</p>
