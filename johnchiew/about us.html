        The Club is firmly based on the beliefs and principles established by Gichin Funakoshi (1868-1957)
        <br>
        The priciples the Shotokan School is based upon the details below. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Never forget: karate begins with rei and ends with rei (Rei means courtesy or respect, and is represented in karate by bowing)
        <br>
        There is no first attack in karate
        <br>
        Karate supports righteousness
        <br>
        First understand yourself, then understand others
        <br>
        The art of developing the mind is more important than the art of applying technique
        <br>
        The mind needs to be freed
        <br>
        Trouble is born of negligence / ignorance
        <br>
        Do not think karate belongs only in the dojo
        <br>
        Karate training requires a lifetime
        <br>
        Transform everything into karate; therein lies its exquisiteness
        <br>
        Karate is like hot water, if you do not give it heat constantly, it will again become cold water
        <br>
        Do not think that you have to win, rather think you do not have to lose
        <br>
        Transform yourself according to the opponent
        <br>
        The outcome of the fight depends on one's control
        <br>
        Imagine one's arms and legs as swords
        <br>
        Once you leave the shelter of home, there are a million enemies
        <br>
        Postures are for the beginner; later they are natural positions
        <br>
        Perform the kata correctly; the real fight is a different matter
        <br>
        Do not forget control of the dynamics of power, the elasticity of the body and the speed of the technique
        <br>
        Apply the way of Karate to all things. Therein lies its beauty.
