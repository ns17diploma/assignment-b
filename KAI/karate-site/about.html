						There is no first attack in karate			
					</li>
					<li>
						Karate supports righteousness			
					</li>
					<li>
						First understand yourself, then understand others

						Do not think karate belongs only in the dojo

					<li>
						Karate training requires a lifetime		
					</li>
					<li>
						Transform everything into karate; therein lies its exquisiteness	
					</li>
					<li>
						Karate is like hot water, if you do not give it heat constantly, it will again become cold water
					</li>
					<li>
						Do not think that you have to win, rather think you do not have to lose		
					</li>
					<li>
						Transform yourself according to the opponent		
					</li>
					<li>
						The outcome of the fight depends on one's control		
					</li>
					<li>
						Imagine one's arms and legs as swords		
					</li>
					<li>
						Once you leave the shelter of home, there are a million enemies		
					</li>
					<li>
						Postures are for the beginner; later they are natural positions		
					</li>
					<li>
						Perform the kata correctly; the real fight is a different matter		
					</li>
					<li>
						Do not forget control of the dynamics of power, the elasticity of the body and the speed of the technique					
					</li>
					<li>
						Apply the way of Karate to all things. Therein lies its beauty.
