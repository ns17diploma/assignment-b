          The Club is firmly based on the beliefs and principles established by Gichin Funakoshi (1868-1957)
          <br>
          The priciples the Shotokan School is based upon the details below. 
          <br>
          Never forget: karate begins with rei and ends with rei (Rei means courtesy or respect, and is represented in karate by bowing)
          There is no first attack in karate
          Karate supports righteousness
          First understand yourself, then understand others
          The art of developing the mind is more important than the art of applying technique
          The mind needs to be freed
          Trouble is born of negligence / ignorance
          Do not think karate belongs only in the dojo
          Karate training requires a lifetime
          Transform everything into karate; therein lies its exquisiteness
          Karate is like hot water, if you do not give it heat constantly, it will again become cold water
          Do not think that you have to win, rather think you do not have to lose
          Transform yourself according to the opponent
          The outcome of the fight depends on one's control
          Imagine one's arms and legs as swords
          Once you leave the shelter of home, there are a million enemies
          Postures are for the beginner; later they are natural positions
          Perform the kata correctly; the real fight is a different matter
          Do not forget control of the dynamics of power, the elasticity of the body and the speed of the technique
          Apply the way of Karate to all things. Therein lies its beauty.
