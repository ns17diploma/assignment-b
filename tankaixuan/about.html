					The Club is firmly based on the beliefs and principles established by Gichin Funakoshi (1868-1957)
					<br>
					The priciples the Shotokan School is based upon the details below. 
					<br>
					Never forget: karate begins with rei and ends with rei (Rei means courtesy or respect, and is represented in karate by bowing)
					There is no first attack in karate
					Karate supports righteousness
					First understand yourself, then understand others
					The art of developing the mind is more important than the art of applying technique
					The mind needs to be freed
					Trouble is born of negligence / ignorance
					Do not think karate belongs only in the dojo
					Karate training requires a lifetime
					Transform everything into karate; therein lies its exquisiteness
					Karate is like hot water, if you do not give it heat constantly, it will again become cold water
					Do not think that you have to win, rather think you do not have to lose
					Transform yourself according to the opponent
					The outcome of the fight depends on one's control
					Imagine one's arms and legs as swords
					Once you leave the shelter of home, there are a million enemies
					Postures are for the beginner; later they are natural positions
					Perform the kata correctly; the real fight is a different matter
					Do not forget control of the dynamics of power, the elasticity of the body and the speed of the technique
					Apply the way of Karate to all things. Therein lies its beauty.
