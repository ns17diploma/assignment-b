				The Club is firmly based on the beliefs and principles established by Gichin Funakoshi (1868-1957)<br>

				The priciples the Shotokan School is based upon the details below. <br>

				Never forget: karate begins with rei and ends with rei (Rei means courtesy or respect, and is represented in karate by bowing)
				There is no first attack in karate<br>
				Karate supports righteousness
				First understand yourself, then understand others
				The art of developing the mind is more important than the art of applying technique<br>
				The mind needs to be freed
				Trouble is born of negligence / ignorance
				Do not think karate belongs only in the dojo
				Karate training requires a lifetime<br>
				Transform everything into karate; therein lies its exquisiteness
				Karate is like hot water, if you do not give it heat constantly, it will again become cold water<br>
				Do not think that you have to win, rather think you do not have to lose
				Transform yourself according to the opponent<br>
				The outcome of the fight depends on one's control
				Imagine one's arms and legs as swords
				Once you leave the shelter of home,<br>
				there are a million enemies
				Postures are for the beginner; later they are natural positions
				Perform the kata correctly;<br>the real fight is a different matter
				Do not forget control of the dynamics of power, the elasticity of the body and the speed of the technique<br>
				Apply the way of Karate to all things. Therein lies its beauty.
